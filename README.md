This project is intended to culminate in a 'Canadian supplement and update' to _Sowell, Thomas. [Basic Economics](https://www.amazon.ca/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465060730), 5d ed. (2015)_.

Status: summary of principles in progress of being compiled.

* OVERVIEW
  * Chapter 1: What Is Economics?
    * Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources that have alternative uses.
    * The role of economics is to study cause and effect, showing what happens when you do specific things in specific ways.
    * **What is relevant is the incentives created by economic decisions, not the intended goals of those decisions.**
* PART I:  PRICES AND MARKETS
  * Chapter 2: The Role of Prices 
    * The role of prices is to allocate resources to their most valued uses. Prices signal how much individuals value a resources relative to others who value those same resources. Price changes occur organically as individuals adjust their behaviour in response to changes in supply and demand.
    * Losses are as important as gains in providing price signals. Gains provide incentives to individuals to _do_ something. Losses provide individuals with incentives to _not do_ something.
    * **Price should not be confused with cost. From the standpoint of society, the "cost" of anything is the value it has in alternative uses.** 
    * As a general principle, **the price which one consumer is willing to pay for a resource is the price other consumers are forced to pay for that same resource.**
    * The adjustments to individual behaviour are incremental as prices change. This is known as incremental substitution. Therefore, resources organically flow to their most valued uses. People buy more at a lower price, and buy less at a higher price. Producers supply more at a higher price, and supply less at a lower price.
    * No individual or set of individuals can read and react to the constant flood of price signals generated by the activity of billions of humans.
    *  **There is seldom a fixed "need" for a resource.** The relevant issue is how to best use the available quantity.
    * Competition is the reason why no actor can "greedily" raise prices, if other actors continue to supply at the "correct" price.
  * Chapter 3: Price Controls 
    * No government can "set" the price of a resource. *Government policy that artificially controls the price of a resource diverts those resources from their most efficient use to less efficient uses.* 
    * Distorting effects of price ceilings:
      * Shortage (producers have incentive to reduce supply)
      * Quality deterioration (producers have no incentive to maintain or improve quality)
      * Hoarding (higher demand at a lower price)
      * Black markets (talk is cheap, humans speak with their wallets)
    * Distorting effects of price floors:
      * Surplus and waste (producers have incentive to produce in excess of demand)
      * Diverts resources away from economically valuable activity 
    * Price controls are stupid, but often politically expedient to sell a quick fix, with others left to deal with the consequences.
  * Chapter 4: An Overview of Prices 
    * Economics is the analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships in an economy, and to discern the consequences of various ways of allocating scarce resources that have alternative uses.
    * The analysis is complex because the reciprocal, systemic interactions between many different forces, like the interaction between billiard balls on a pool table after the opening shot. 
    * Systemic causation: what each individual wants is obstructed and encouraged in part by the intentions of everyone else, and what emerges is something no one willed but is a fair proxy for what "we" want. Many economic fallacies are the result of ascribing intentional actions to outcomes rather than systemic causation.
    * Systemically irrational outcomes can result from the collective effect of rational individual actions in light of the incentives created by policy in the marketplace. 
    * Incentives versus goals: **people will usually do more for their own benefit than they will do for others**. This is why incentives matter, and goals do not. "Not enough" and "prohibitively expensive" are terms of judgment in light of goals, rather than an assessment of incentives.
    * Scarcity and competition: invidiuals do not have to know they are competing with each other to drive scarcity. In fact this is a  benefit. Commerce is the world's most spoken language, and every day Americans transact with their political and ideological idols without even knowing it. Economic interdependece fosters political stability
* PART II: INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 
  * Chapter 5: The Rise and Fall of Businesses
    * Businesses are not a proxy for greed and profits. Half of businesses fail within four years.
    * Just as companies rise and fall, so does profitability. Judging the "greed" of companies based on their peaks in profitability is nonsensical. Profitability is a derivative of the efficient allocation of scare resources, not a subjective selection by executives.
    * Factors affecting changes in the profitability of businesses over time: social change, economic change, technological change, changes in business leadership, Many thriving businesses fail quickly once social changes take hold: A&P, US Steel, railroads, department stores.
  * Chapter 6: The Role of Profits–and Losses 
    * Profits and losses are equally important in guiding resources to their most productive uses.
    * Market competition, an unmonitored monitor, is the check on 'unreasonable' profits.
    * A producer who does not respond to the market as well as its competitors will become less profitable. 
      The producer will then adjust to conditions and improve profitability, cycling over time.
    * Profit rates change over time, and are a reflection of productivity relative to other uses of resources in the economy. 
  Judging a profit rate by itself is meaningless.
      * The ideal size of a business depends on the alternative use for resources and changes over a time even in established industries. 
        * Middlemen play an important role in matching producers and buyers. Less developed economies have less wealthy residents 
    who cannot purchase at the same scale as in developed countries. Middlemen help to aggregate demand and leverage economies of scale.
          Fewer middlemen than is appropriate in the circumstances means less selection, less competition, and _higher_ prices.
  * Chapter 7: The Economics of Big Business 
    * Corporations have allowed economies of scale to develop through limitation of liability and pooling of capital.
    * Corporations have imperfect, federated power structures that allow shareholders to delegate control and govern by proxy.
    * Most alleged monopolies are not in fact monopolies in substance but through creative characterization to fulfill political whim (Brown Shoes: monopoly in 'rubber-soled' shoes,
      Microsoft (monopoly on 'Intel-based' computers). 
    * Cartels usually collapse because of intense competition between competitive rivals, who try to circumvent unwritten understandings to personal advantage.
