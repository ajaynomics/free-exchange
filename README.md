Status: summary of principles in progress of being compiled.

* OVERVIEW
    * Chapter 1: What Is Economics?
        * Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources that have alternative uses.
        * The role of economics is to study cause and effect, showing what happens when you do specific things in
          specific ways.
        * **What is relevant is the incentives created by economic decisions, not the intended goals of those
          decisions.**
* PART I:  PRICES AND MARKETS
    * Chapter 2: The Role of Prices
        * The role of prices is to allocate resources to their most valued uses. Prices signal how much individuals
          value a resources relative to others who value those same resources. Price changes occur organically as
          individuals adjust their behaviour in response to changes in supply and demand.
        * Losses are as important as gains in providing price signals. Gains provide incentives to individuals to _do_
          something. Losses provide individuals with incentives to _not do_ something.
        * **Price should not be confused with cost. From the standpoint of society, the "cost" of anything is the value
          it has in alternative uses.**
        * As a general principle, **the price which one consumer is willing to pay for a resource is the price other
          consumers are forced to pay for that same resource.**
        * The adjustments to individual behaviour are incremental as prices change. This is known as incremental
          substitution. Therefore, resources organically flow to their most valued uses. People buy more at a lower
          price, and buy less at a higher price. Producers supply more at a higher price, and supply less at a lower
          price.
        * No individual or set of individuals can read and react to the constant flood of price signals generated by the
          activity of billions of humans.
        * **There is seldom a fixed "need" for a resource.** The relevant issue is how to best use the available
          quantity.
        * Competition is the reason why no actor can "greedily" raise prices, if other actors continue to supply at
          the "correct" price.
    * Chapter 3: Price Controls
        * No government can "set" the price of a resource. *Government policy that artificially controls the price of a
          resource diverts those resources from their most efficient use to less efficient uses.*
        * Distorting effects of price ceilings:
            * Shortage (producers have incentive to reduce supply)
            * Quality deterioration (producers have no incentive to maintain or improve quality)
            * Hoarding (higher demand at a lower price)
            * Black markets (talk is cheap, humans speak with their wallets)
        * Distorting effects of price floors:
            * Surplus and waste (producers have incentive to produce in excess of demand)
            * Diverts resources away from economically valuable activity
        * Price controls are stupid, but often politically expedient to sell a quick fix, with others left to deal with
          the consequences.
    * Chapter 4: An Overview of Prices
        * Economics is the analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships in an economy, and to discern the consequences
          of various ways of allocating scarce resources that have alternative uses.
        * The analysis is complex because the reciprocal, systemic interactions between many different forces, like the
          interaction between billiard balls on a pool table after the opening shot.
        * Systemic causation: what each individual wants is obstructed and encouraged in part by the intentions of
          everyone else, and what emerges is something no one willed but is a fair proxy for what "we" want. Many
          economic fallacies are the result of ascribing intentional actions to outcomes rather than systemic causation.
        * Systemically irrational outcomes can result from the collective effect of rational individual actions in light
          of the incentives created by policy in the marketplace.
        * Incentives versus goals: **people will usually do more for their own benefit than they will do for others**.
          This is why incentives matter, and goals do not. "Not enough" and "prohibitively expensive" are terms of
          judgment in light of goals, rather than an assessment of incentives.
        * Scarcity and competition: invidiuals do not have to know they are competing with each other to drive scarcity.
          In fact this is a benefit. Commerce is the world's most spoken language, and every day Americans transact with
          their political and ideological idols without even knowing it. Economic interdependece fosters political
          stability
* PART II: INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
    * Chapter 5: The Rise and Fall of Businesses
        * Businesses are not a proxy for greed and profits. Half of businesses fail within four years.
        * Just as companies rise and fall, so does profitability. Judging the "greed" of companies based on their peaks
          in profitability is nonsensical. Profitability is a derivative of the efficient allocation of scare resources,
          not a subjective selection by executives.
        * Factors affecting changes in the profitability of businesses over time: social change, economic change,
          technological change, changes in business leadership, Many thriving businesses fail quickly once social
          changes take hold: A&P, US Steel, railroads, department stores.
    * Chapter 6: The Role of Profits–and Losses
        * Profits and losses are equally important in guiding resources to their most productive uses.
        * Market competition, an unmonitored monitor, is the check on 'unreasonable' profits.
        * A producer who does not respond to the market as well as its competitors will become less profitable. The
          producer will then adjust to conditions and improve profitability, cycling over time.
        * Profit rates change over time, and are a reflection of productivity relative to other uses of resources in the
          economy. Judging a profit rate by itself is meaningless.
            * The ideal size of a business depends on the alternative use for resources and changes over a time even in
              established industries.
                * Middlemen play an important role in matching producers and buyers. Less developed economies have less
                  wealthy residents who cannot purchase at the same scale as in developed countries. Middlemen help to
                  aggregate demand and leverage economies of scale. Fewer middlemen than is appropriate in the
                  circumstances means less selection, less competition, and _higher_ prices.
    * Chapter 7: The Economics of Big Business
        * Corporations have allowed economies of scale to develop through limitation of liability and pooling of
          capital.
        * Corporations have imperfect, federated power structures that allow shareholders to delegate control and govern
          by proxy.
    * Chapter 8: Regulation and Anti-Trust Laws
        * Most alleged monopolies are not in fact monopolies in substance but through creative characterization to
          fulfill political whim (Brown Shoes: monopoly in 'rubber-soled' shoes, Microsoft (monopoly on 'Intel-based'
          computers). Are the compared items truly 'the same'?
        * Cartels usually collapse because of intense competition between competitive rivals, who try to circumvent
          unwritten understandings to personal advantage.
        * Anti-trust laws that prevent restrictions on market activity are desirable. Modern anti-trust cases tend to be
          politically-driven and impair market decisions.
    * Chapter 9: Market and Non-Market Economies
        * Non-market entities do not have to respond to market forces, and are historically less efficient.
        * Every system has winners and losers. In the market, these incentives encourage changes in human behaviour to
          put resources to their best uses. In other systems, winners and losers are subject to political whim and
          other 'subjective' factors.
* PART III: WORK AND PAY
    * Chapter 10: Productivity and Pay
        * Labour is a resource, like any other, and its market price incentives humans to put resources to their best
          uses.
        * To treat labour as a special resource is to artificially create winners and losers in a manner that impairs
          putting resources to their best use, costing everyone.
        * Notions of 'exploitation' or 'living wage' fail to understand that all spending decisions involve tradeoffs.
          That's the definition of scarcity.
        * Income 'distribution' ought not to be compared in percentage terms but in absolute terms. If everyone is
          better off than they would be under alternative systems, what is wrong about some, who best align their
          actions with the best use of resources, being better off, creating a virtuous cycle of prosperity?
        * Lost in discussion about income distribution is the more important discussion about income mobility. To
          compare '
          classes' of income is to compare the fortunes of non-existent people. Individual actors move through the
          classes of income over time, and as long as that mobility exists, the distinction between classes of income is
          less significant.
        * The best way to prevent job discrimination is _not_ legislating standards, which allow bad actors to hide
          their prejudice. In a free market, those that make business decisions on the basis of prejudices will lose out
          to the competition, which can draw from a larger pool of qualified candidates.
    * Chapter 11: Minimum Wage Laws
        * minimum wage laws make it illegal to pay less than the wage set by government
        * benefits the worker whose wages are lifted without a corresponding increase in productivity
        * impairs any underemployed person willing to do the same job for less than the minimum wage
        * impairs all consumers who pay ultimately pay more for goods and services
            * minimum wage laws create a _surplus_, diverting resources from their most efficient use
        * **the real minimum wage is always $0**
        * Example:
            * Switzerland and Singapore have no minimum wage, and have very low unemployment
            * Canada's unemployment rate is higher than the US, as is the general provincial minimum wage
            * US jurisdictions with 'living wage' laws have higher unemployment than those that don't
        * economists universally (> 85%) agree about the effects of minimum wage laws on unemployment
            * but minimum wage laws are set by government, facing political considerations
        * just as a price set below the market level leads to a deterioration of the quality of the product, minimum
          wage laws deteriorate the quality of the goods and services derived from labour subject to wage controls
        * minimum wage laws generally have a _differential impact_ on minority groups
            * _black Americans are impaired by minimum wage laws becuse they enable racists to hire less-productive
              workers without facing consequences in the market_
            * without a minimum wage law, racist employers are hurting themselves by allowing their competitors to hire
              more productive, less-expensive workers
            * minimum wage laws generally correlate with higher black unemployment
    * Chapter 12: Special Problems in Labor Markets
      * Because humans are complex beings subject to culture, welfare systems, and other subjective factors, labour presents challenges that don't exist with commodities
        * The _unemployment rate_ is determined based on the number of people _seeking_ work, not the number of people _capable_ of work.
          * Because humans transition between 'seeking work' and 'not seeking work' at times in their lives, the statistic could be misleading
          * the unemployment rate could go 'down' because people are giving up on finding work
      * When technology replaces human workers, the benefit of efficiencies to the broader population are diffuse, but the cost to displaced workers is intensive, creating a political interest that could shadow the economic interests
        * the political calculus: will I win more 'worker' votes than I lose 'employer' votes
      * Improving working conditions is the same thing as increasing wages
         * Growth in per capita output is the best way to improve wages and working conditions
      * Safety laws are justified to the extent they protect third-party interests (mud flaps, ok; airbags, not ok)
      * Child labour laws emerged from an era when children were forced to work the mines, whereas today they are an artificial barrier to youth employment and learning, that is often advanced by labour unions who want to protect their membership from alternate sources of labour that may reduce wages.
      * Policies such as mandated time off, caps on hours worked, etc, all represent an artificial misalocation of resources that have better uses
