* OVERVIEW
  * Chapter 1: What Is Economics?
    * Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources that have alternative uses.
    * The role of economics is to study cause and effect, showing what happens when you do specific things in specific ways.
    * **What is relevant is the incentives created by economic decisions, not the intended goals of those decisions.**
* PART I:  PRICES AND MARKETS
  * Chapter 2: The Role of Prices 
    * The role of prices is to allocate resources to their most valued uses. Prices signal how much individuals value a resources relative to others who value those same resources. Price changes occur organically as individuals adjust their behaviour in response to changes in supply and demand.
    * No individual or set of individuals can read and react to the constant flood of price signals generated by the activity of billions of humans.
    * Losses are as important as gains in providing price signals. Gains provide incentives to individuals to _do_ something. Losses provide individuals with incentives to _not do_ something.
    * **Price should not be confused with cost. From the standpoint of society, the "cost" of anything is the value it has in alternative uses.** 
    * As a general principle, **the price which one consumer is willing to pay for a resource is the price other consumers are forced to pay for that same resource.**
    * The adjustments to individual behaviour are incremental as prices change. This is known as incremental substitution. Therefore, resources organically flow to their most valued uses.
